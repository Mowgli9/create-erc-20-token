# how I can create a token using this script
    - it's simple all what you need to do is go to scripts 
        -> main.py and change some variable like:

        - hom_much_token_you_want_to_creat = "the total supply of the token"
        - token_name = "What you wanna called this token"
        - token symbole = "per example you cann called bitcoin => BTC or Etheruem => ETh"
